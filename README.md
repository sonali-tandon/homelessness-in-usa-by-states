# DATA VISUALIZATION ON HOMELESSNESS IN USA BY STATES FROM 2007-2020

The dataset used is PIT (Point-in-Time) and HIC (Housing Inventory Count) Data since 2007. This dataset is a combination of the PIT and HIC dataset that is sourced from the HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) Exchange. The Point-in-Time(PIT) is a count that is conducted on the last 10 days of every January. It provides information on sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness and is counted on a single night in January. The PIT count is a nationwide effort to tally the number of unsheltered Americans living on the street on a single night in January. It began in 2003 and happens every two years. Housing Inventory Count (HIC) is a collection of information about the beds and units in each Continuum of Care(CoC).
